> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." — **Steve Jobs**
> "I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what’s next." — **Steve Jobs**
> *And for me, that’s all about security, penetration testing, and breaking stuff to fix it and don't stop there.*
